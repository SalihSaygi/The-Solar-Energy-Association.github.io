# SEA Website Project Directory

This is the project directory page for the SEA Website Project. The end goal is to have a new, fully-functional website for the Solar Energy Association at UC Merced.

Contact Shawn Duong (sduong@ucmerced.edu; Discord: skat#4502) to join this project. You'll be given the **@Website Team** role on Discord. This isn't just for coders and CSE people! A website needs authors, editors, artists, designers, and so much more. This is truly multidisciplinary and we welcome everyone. Everything can be taught â€” no experience necessary.
